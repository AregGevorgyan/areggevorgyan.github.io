`redis-rope` is a fast and versatile
[rope](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)>) data type for
large strings in [Redis](https://redis.io), distributed as a native
[module](https://redis.io/docs/reference/modules/). It's primarily written in
Zig and tested with Rust.

Ropes are a more efficient data structure for large strings (indexed sequences
of bytes). Unlike ordinary strings, ropes let you do some operations up to
exponentially faster than their counterparts, and they're particularly good at
speeding up complex operations on large strings.

More than just being theoretically interesting, this module also tries to be
somewhat _practical_ by caring about safety, correctness, and speed. It
approaches the performance of ordinary strings for simple operations and is
hundreds of times faster for complex operations.
