sshx takes your terminal and shares it on the web. It works on screens of all
sizes. Create new windows, resize, drag and drop, and see other people's cursors
as they type, with live output. Everything is end-to-end encrypted over a
low-latency global server mesh.

This was the synthesis of multiple years of planning, development and
experimentation. The result is a unique sofware artifact. It combines work as a
solo engineer, crafting a complex, stateful, performant streaming system that
expands what computers can do, and as a designer thinking about new, intentional
ways for people to learn and communicate.
