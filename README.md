Source code for my personal website, hosted on Github Pages. I used the template
from [Eric Zhang](https://www.ekzhang.com/),
https://github.com/ekzhang/ekzhang.github.io. His code is open source with no
licence.

This website is powered by [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). To develop, run:

```sh-session
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Run `prettier --ignore-path .gitignore --write --plugin-search-dir=. .` to format your code before committing.
