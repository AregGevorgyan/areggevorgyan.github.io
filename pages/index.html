    <p>
      Hello! I am a first-year student at Harvard University studying
      mathematics and computer science. I am also a
      <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/ekzhang"
        >competitive programmer</a
      >
      and <a href="https://youtu.be/49jhL-T5Tow">musician</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love programming and am usually working on
      <a href="/projects">side projects</a>, especially those that combine
      science and art in interesting ways. My favorite languages are Python,
      C++, and JavaScript, though I have worked with a wide variety of languages
      and technologies in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      My academic interests are broadly in computer science. Right now, I am
      exploring theoretical computer science, programming languages, and machine
      learning, although I am still deciding where I will focus in the future. I
      am currently an undergraduate researcher in the
      <a href="https://www.predmed.org/">Predictive Medicine Group</a> under Ben
      Reis, and I will be a teaching fellow for
      <a href="https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~libcs124/cs124/syllabus.html"
        >CS 124 (Data Structures and Algorithms)</a
      >
      in Spring 2020.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also the coauthor of an upcoming physics book for high school
      students with Branislav Kisaƒçanin; the latest draft is available online
      <a href="https://www.aapt.org/physicsteam/2020/pastexams.cfm">here</a>.

      <h2>Competitive Programming</h2>
      <p>
        In high school, I won two gold medals representing the US at the
        International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). I am still actively
        involved in the competitive programming space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programming competitions I have helped organize or written/tested
        problems for include:

          <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/pwshpc-online-round"
            >PWSH Programming Contest</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://usaco.org/">USA Computing Olympiad (USACO)</a>
        </li>
        <li>

          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I maintain an algorithm and data structure library available
        <a href="http://ekzlib.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. If you are looking for
        tutoring, I teach online and summer camp courses with
        <a href="https://alphastar.academy/courses/cs-courses/"
          >Alphastar&nbsp;Academy</a
        >
        for students aiming to perform at a high level in the USACO contests.
