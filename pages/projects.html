      <p class="lead">A real-time, multiplayer online card game.</p>
      <p>
        This is a web-based implementation of a real-time pattern matching card
        game called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)">Set</a>. The
        idea of this project originated at SPARC 2019, when I was thinking about
        how I could bridge the 3000 mile gap between some of the friends I'd
        made, after we part ways. This web application lets you play Set online
        with minimal overhead (no login); it's as simple as sharing a link to
        invite players to join the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the process of designing this application, I heard great things about
        Firebase (a database service provided by Google), so this app ended up
        serving as my introduction to serverless databases, as well as an
        exercise in live interface design. I used animations and colors to
        provide visual cues that made the application much more usable, without
        becoming distracting.
