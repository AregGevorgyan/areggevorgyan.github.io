      Learn computer graphics by writing GPU shaders!
    </p>
    <p markdown="1">
      This workshop contains a selection of self-guided projects designed to teach the basics of computer graphics. Each project introduces an important graphics technique that is extensively used in real-world applications. The code is designed to run in real time on modern GPUs, without requiring any extra software. I wrote this when frustrated with the lack of proper documentation and simple code examples for GPU shaders.

      The topics include fragment shaders ([GLSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language)), procedural texture generation, rasterization, lighting calculations, and real-time ray tracing. I hosted a live version of this workshop at Harvard, and it has also been used by hundreds of self-learners after gaining popularity in the [/r/gamedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/) community.
