      This was one of my first fun programming projects, a visual experiment
      simulating gravity in a system with hundreds of interacting objects.
      Calculations are done using simple physics formulas, with a bit of damping
      to make them more robust. The user can click to add an invisible mass that
      attracts all objects to the cursor. Everything is rendered in real time on
      a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element, and it's quite satisfying to move
      the colorful balls around!
