      A competitive programmer's library of algorithms and data structures in
      C++.
    </p>
    <p>
      I maintain an open-source library of about thirty-five C++ templates for
      algorithms and data structures. These are fairly advanced tricks targeted
      toward top competitive programmers, including fast implementations of FFT,
      Aho-Corasick string search, and Dinic's blocking flow algorithm, as well
      as data structures like link-cut trees and centroid decomposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is accessible on a static website, which I developed using Angular.
      The website also includes a searchable collection of more than 600
      code samples from other open-source libraries.
