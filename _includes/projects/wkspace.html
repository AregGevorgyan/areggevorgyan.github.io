      An online, cloud-synchronized workspace for competitive programmers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In competitive programming, speed is crucial, and some end up wasting a
      lot of time moving between making new programs from templates, creating
      input files, and running code on provided test data. Inspired by
      <a href="https://csacademy.com/">CS Academy</a>'s interface, this website
      provides an integrated problem viewer and code editor with compilation and
      testing built in to eliminate this friction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The server scrapes problems from Codeforces and displays their statements
      side-by-side with user code. It also parses sample tests and implements
      parallel verification on all test data with the click of a button&mdash;no
      copying and pasting required. Programs are autosaved and synchronized with
      a MongoDB instance, so it persists across sessions and browsers.
      Basically, everything that a competitive programmer needs, with no local
      environment setup!
