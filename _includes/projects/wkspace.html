      An online, cloud-synchronized workspace for competitive programmers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're a top competitive programmer, you have a dedicated setup on your
      local machine that lets you quickly creating new programs from templates,
      generate input files, and run code on sets of test data. But what if
      you're working on a different computer, and you don't have all these tools
      installed?

    <p>
      This is a side-by-side problem viewer and code editor that allows you to
      run code online. It even has advanced features like autocompletion and
      automatically parses of test cases for each problem, so you don't need to
      manually copy-paste these yourself. This was inspired by
      <a href="https://csacademy.com/">CS Academy</a>'s interface.

    <p>
      To accomplish this, the web server lets you scrape problems from online
      judges at the click of a button. Your code is safe, as it's autosaved and
      synchronized with a MongoDB instance in the cloud, so it even persists
      across sessions and browsers. Try it below!
