      An online, cloud-synchronized workspace for competitive programmers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspired by <a href="https://csacademy.com/">CS Academy</a>'s workspace
      and editor interface, this website provides an integrated problem viewer
      and code editor with compilation and testing built in. In competitive
      programming, speed is crucial, and people end up wasting a lot of time
      repeating the same process of making new programs from templates, creating
      input files, and running code on provided test data.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website scrapes problems from Codeforces and displays their
      statements side-by-side with your code. It also parses sample tests and
      lets you do parallel verification on all test data with the click of a
      button&mdash;no copying and pasting required. Your code is autosaved and
      synchronized with a MongoDB instance, so it persists across sessions and
      browsers. Everything that a competitive programmer needs is packaged in a
      convenient website with no local environment setup required.
